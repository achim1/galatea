*Geant4 based analysis and simlation toolset for astroparticle physiscs*

So far, this is more or less a playground for me to learn how to efficiently use the hep stack. Simulate a detector geometry, mass produce, analyze the results.
The task is to wrap the available library calls of geant4 (and most likely CERN's root) in a friendly way, which allows for rapid development of new detectors. Inspired by the GAPS software.
